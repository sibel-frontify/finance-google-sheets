# Data to Google Sheets for Finance

This is where we store the code used to pull data from our MySQL DB to Google Sheets for Finance.  

The scripts are written in Python and require setting up access from Python to Google Sheets API in order to read and write data in Google Sheets using Python. 

This is a helpful page to get started:

Other information on packages needed/formatting of credentials will be added here.
